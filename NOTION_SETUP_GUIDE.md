## üé® Content Creation Tips

### Blog Posts
- Write your content directly in the Notion page below the properties
- Use standard Notion blocks: headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes
- Images and embeds work automatically
- Set `Published` to true when ready to go live

### Case Studies
- Add detailed content in the page body for the full case study view
- Use headings to structure sections like "Background", "Process", "Results"
- Include screenshots, metrics, and visuals
- The main properties will show on the portfolio overview page

## üöÄ Going Live

1. Add your content to the databases
2. Set `Published` to true
3. Deploy your website
4. Your content will automatically appear!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No posts/case studies showing"
- Check that `NOTION_TOKEN` is correct
- Verify database IDs are accurate
- Ensure databases are shared with your integration
- Make sure `Published` is checked on your content

### "Images not loading"
- Upload images directly to Notion (don't use external links)
- Notion will handle the image hosting automatically

### "Content not updating"
- Changes in Notion may take a few minutes to appear
- Clear your browser cache if needed

## üìù Content Workflow

1. **Draft**: Create new entries with `Published` unchecked
2. **Review**: Write and refine your content
3. **Publish**: Check the `Published` box
4. **Update**: Edit anytime - changes appear automatically

## üéØ Pro Tips

- Use consistent slug naming (lowercase, hyphens)
- Keep excerpts under 200 characters
- Add relevant categories for better organization
- Use high-quality images (1200x630 recommended)
- Test with `Published` unchecked first

Your JANUS website now has a powerful, easy-to-use CMS! üéâ
