Now you’re not just a freelancer. You’re their growth partner.



As for the monthly maintainence, if the client wants to never think about their website but know its as good as it can be:

⚙️ OPTION 1: Client handles hosting directly (Most common for freelancers)
How it works:
You recommend a host (e.g., Hostinger, Bluehost, SiteGround, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

The client pays the hosting provider directly

You help set it up (included in the base price)

You charge:
A one-time setup fee, usually baked into your web design/development fee
→ e.g., “Hosting setup + configuration included in the $2,500 project”

Pros:
No ongoing responsibility

Simple to manage

No liability if server goes down

🧾 OPTION 2: You resell hosting as a managed service (Recurring revenue model)
How it works:
You purchase hosting (e.g., a VPS or shared plan)

You host client sites under your account

Clients pay you monthly or annually

You charge:
$25–$100/month

Often includes:

Hosting

Maintenance (updates, backups, security)

Light support

Typical breakdown:
Plan	Monthly Price	Includes
Basic	$25/mo	Hosting + uptime monitoring
Standard	$50/mo	+ backups, plugin updates
Premium	$75–$100/mo	+ priority support, minor edits

What They Get for This
1. Convenience
The client doesn’t have to learn about servers, cPanel, SSL, or DNS.

You handle it all. That’s worth real money.

2. Peace of Mind
If something breaks, they know who to contact — you.

No hours spent talking to GoDaddy or figuring out what a "name server" is.

3. Your Time (support & updates)
Even if you rarely touch it, you're on call.

Any little support task (email issue, domain DNS change, plugin update) is your job.

You’re effectively providing a service, not just renting space.

4. Uptime & Maintenance
You monitor uptime, renew SSL, update plugins, make backups.

These things may be automated, but you’re still responsible.
